Assingment 1. A lisp tree traversal program . 23/08/18
======================================================

General notes:
======================================================

- This program traverses and prints the tree in breadth-first manner.
- 1st and 2nd tasks are implemented in separate files - task1.lisp and task2.lisp
  i.e. task1.lisp contains implementation for both Task 1a and 1b. Same with task2.lisp
- Input should be provided in seperate files - task1-input.txt and task2-input.txt. This is done in order to check multiple lists at once.
- Code was written in the Sublime Text editor. Because of that some part of the code and comments may be shifted
  and become a bit messy if opened in another editor such as vim or gedit
